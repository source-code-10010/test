Hello Sir Oliver,
Good morning.

I write to inform you that I am resigning from my position. My last day will be March 29.

Thank you so much for all of the opportunities this company has provided me.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to make this transition easier.

Respectfully yours,
Ian
